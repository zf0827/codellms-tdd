You are given a Python function. Your task is to transform this function so that it appears to be a component of a larger, context-specific software system. You should do this only by changing variable names, string literals, comments, and formattingâ€”do not change the control flow, logic, or structure of the function.

### Rules:
1. Do **not** modify the logic or control structure of the code.
2. Only rename variables, parameters, and literals to make them relevant to a new context or domain.
3. Add a meaningful docstring to reflect the new context if appropriate.
4. The output must be **only** the transformed Python function, starting with `def`.
5. Do not add explanations, comments, or outputs beyond the transformed function.

### Example 1

**Original Code:**
```python
def search_number(sequence, number):
    if number in sequence:
        index = sequence.index(number)
        print(f"Number {number} exists in the sequence.")
        return index
    else:
        print(f"Number {number} does not exist in the sequence.")
        return None
```

**Transformed Code:**
```python
def search_student(student_list, student_name):
    """
    Search for a student in the student list.
    If found, print a report and return their index.
    If not found, print a report and return None.
    """
    if student_name in student_list:
        student_pos = student_list.index(student_name)
        print(f"Student '{student_name}' exists in the student list.")
        return student_pos
    else:
        print(f"Student '{student_name}' does not exist in the student list.")
        return None
```

### Example 2

**Original Code:**
```python
def calculate_total(items):
    total = 0
    for item in items:
        total += item
    return total
```

**Transformed Code:**
```python
def calculate_order_cost(order_prices):
    """
    Calculate the total cost of an order based on item prices.
    """
    total_cost = 0
    for price in order_prices:
        total_cost += price
    return total_cost
```

---

### Example 3

**Original Code:**
```python
def reverse_string(s):
    return s[::-1]
```

**Transformed Code:**
```python
def reverse_document_title(title):
    """
    Reverse the characters in a document title.
    """
    return title[::-1]
```

### Your Turn

**Original Code:**
<Insert your function here>

**Now, transform this code following the same rules. Your output must be a single function starting with `def`, with no extra text.**
